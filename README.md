### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArunyaPaul/ntel-Unnati-Final-Submission-PS-13.git
   cd ntel-Unnati-Final-Submission-PS-13
2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download the necessary datasets:
   -Stanford Cars Dataset
   -Pklot Dataset
4. Download the Haar cascade XML file.
5. Clone the YOLOv5 repository and install the required dependencies.

### Usage

1. Dataset Preparation:
   
  - Stanford Cars Dataset:
   
   Download from Kaggle.
   Extract the dataset and upload in Google Drive. The folder structure should be:
   stanford_cars/
    cars_annos.mat
    cars_test/
        cars_test/
            (car images)
    cars_train/
        cars_train/
            (car images)
   
  - Pklot Dataset:
   
   Download from Kaggle.
   Extract the dataset and upload in Google Drive. The folder structure should be:
   pklot/
    test/
        _annotations.coco.json
        (images)
    train/
        _annotations.coco.json
        (images)
    valid/
        _annotations.coco.json
        (images)

2. Google Colab Integration:
   
   -Mount Google Drive to access datasets.
   -Access datasets from Google Drive in your Colab environment.
   
3. Haar Cascade Installation:
   -Download Haar cascade XML file - 'haarcascade_russian_plate_number.xml'.
   -Upload the XML file to your Google Colab environment or edge device.

4.  Clone the YOLOv5 repository and install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    rm -rf yolov5
    git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
    cd yolov5
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Use YOLOv5 models for vehicle detection tasks.

5. Running the Code:
   -Ensure all libraries and dependencies are installed.
   -Follow the instructions in each script to load datasets, preprocess data, train models, and deploy the system.

### Model Training and Evaluation

Follow the instructions in the project structure to train and evaluate models for vehicle classification, number plate detection, vehicle movement analysis, and parking lot occupancy monitoring.

### Edge Deployment

TensorFlow Lite can be used to deploy models on edge devices. Ensure models are optimized for performance and accuracy on the target hardware. A rough code example for edge deployment is provided in the Python notebook, and a similar Flask example code under the section "Sample Code for WebDev Application in Flask" has also also included for future application. These codes generalised examples and are meant to be fine-tuned based on your specific requirements and hardware.
